-For Friday we are modifying a code
(when correctly done, it looks like a red background with a blue diamond in the middle)
(it's not a ridiculous amound of code since we're making use of the library.)
-For Wednesday we are modifying the sieve 

x = a * b
a || b <= sqrt(x)

how do we test if something is a prime number? take the square root. the moment we find a prime number greater than the
square root that still doesn't go into the number it makes it a prime. we've tested everything less than the square root of the number.
