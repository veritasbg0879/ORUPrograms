sieve: prime numbers
billy has a 2 so he doesnt pass on evens
stacy has a three so she doesnt pass on odds that are divisible by three
the next person has a five so she doesnt pass on odds that are divisible by three or five
keep going
the order is 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23

if it factors only by one and itself, its a prime number
